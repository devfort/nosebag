If there is not enough room around the lamb, place the spuds in a separate roasting pan or oven proof dish."

Cook on the heat for a minute, then add the wine, stirring to mix and ensure that no lumps form. Increase the volume of liquid by adding cooking water from the leeks. Taste to check seasoning."
